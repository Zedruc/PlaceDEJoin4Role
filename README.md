Just a little Discordbot to assign roles to members in a Voice Channel

## Setup

To setup the Bot you basically just need to fill in all informations in the `config.json` file. Here's a little explanation what the different informations are for:

**Token:**
    That your Bot can connect to Discord you need to get your Token. Just create a Bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and copy the Token.

**Role:**
    `role` is the role ID you want to assign to the members if they join a Voice Channel.

**Ignore Channel**
    IDs of the Stage channel - ["ID1", "ID2" . . .]

**Cooldown:**
    Cooldown for the bot to not reach the api limit, recommended to be set to something at least greater than 4

**Role Management:**
    The role you want the bot to give to people must be BELOW the bot's role
